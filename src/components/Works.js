              This website is for beginner coders looking to test their knowledge. The quiz consists of 5 simple questions. The quiz is timed and will test you knowledge against the time and questions answered. I am motivated to help fellow coders quiz themselves for practice. I learned how to use javascript and used prior knowledge of css and html to create the web page.

                I embarked on the journey of building this E-commerce application with the objective of crafting a robust set of routes tailored for internet retailers. The motivation behind this project was to empower retail owners with a comprehensive platform that streamlines inventory management, thus enhancing the overall retail experience.
                Throughout the development process, I tackled the challenge of creating an E-commerce solution that seamlessly integrates essential functionalities. This encompassed creating well-defined routes that facilitate effortless operations such as retrieving, adding, updating, and removing items from the inventory.
                By implementing this project, I acquired valuable skills in constructing the backbone of a backend architecture. This involved mastering the art of crafting RESTful APIs and leveraging HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. As a result, I gained proficiency in data manipulation and honed my ability to provide effective solutions to real-world problems faced by retailers.
                This journey not only enabled me to build a functional E-commerce platform but also equipped me with the expertise to create scalable and adaptable backend systems. Through this experience, I've deepened my understanding of database interactions, request handling, and the importance of designing intuitive user experiences for retail professionals.
                In summary, this project stands as a testament to my dedication to software development and showcases my ability to architect comprehensive solutions that cater to the unique needs of internet retailers. It's been an incredible learning experience that has enriched my skill set and solidified my passion for creating impactful applications.

              I was inspired to create this tech blog application to provide a platform for individuals interested in technology. Whether they want to learn, share their insights, or simply stay updated with the tech world, this application offers a space for it all. The primary objective of this project is to foster a sense of community within the tech community. By building this application, I aimed to facilitate the sharing of tech-related thoughts, knowledge, and experiences. It serves as a hub where tech enthusiasts can collaborate, educate, and explore new ideas.
              One of the core issues this project addresses is the fragmentation of tech-related information across various platforms. It consolidates all things tech into one place, making it easier for visitors to fulfill their tech needs. Instead of searching multiple sources, they can find valuable content and discussions here.
              Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and experience in several key areas: Implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to structure the application. Utilizing Handlebars.js as the templating language for rendering dynamic content. Employing Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database management. Implementing user authentication and session management using the express-session npm package. Enhancing my understanding of Heroku deployment for hosting web applications.
              By learning and applying these technologies and concepts, I not only built a functional tech blog application but also enhanced my skills as a developer.

              This webpage is an online dictionary application that defines a word the user wants to search for. The webpage also provides animated pictures about the selected word. This webpage gives users a fun and unique experience searching different vocabulary paired with visual representation. This webpage can help people learn new words, strengthen their vocabulary, have visual inspiration, or get a good laugh. It can be used as a more engaging way to learn about words rather than the traditional search or dictionary uses. Our group learned how to use new APIs and implement them properly. We learned the importance of documentation and how it can help us work through problems throughout our process. We learned how to work in a group to successfully deploy a webpage.
