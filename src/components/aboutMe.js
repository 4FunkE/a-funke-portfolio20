        <p>
        I am an artist and teacher, and developing my skills in coding. 
        I am a BFA/MS graduate of Pratt Institute, School of Art and Design 
        located in Brooklyn, New York. For 6 years my field of study has been 
        in Art and Design Education, however, I hope to grow my abilities in 
        coding where I can apply my knowledge of design and education to contribute 
        to the field of web development. I currently teach at Charlotte Lab Lower Schools.  
        I create personal art using Printmaking, Digital Photography, Performing Arts, 
        Photography, Jewelry/Metal, Drawing, and Glass.
